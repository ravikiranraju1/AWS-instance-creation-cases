                                                 How To configure Docker & Docker-Compose in AWS EC2 [Amazon Linux 2023 AMI]

Configuring Docker and Docker Compose on an AWS EC2 instance running Amazon Linux involves several steps. Below is a guide to help you set it up:

### 1. Launch an EC2 Instance

- Go to the AWS Management Console and launch a new EC2 instance with the Amazon Linux AMI 2023.
- Ensure that the security group associated with the instance allows inbound traffic on ports 22 (SSH) and 80/443 (if you plan to run web services).

### 2. Connect to Your EC2 Instance

- Once your instance is running, connect to it via SSH using your preferred SSH client.

### 3. Update the System

- It's a good practice to update the system packages to the latest versions:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

### 4. Install Docker

- Install Docker CE (Community Edition) using the following commands:

```bash
sudo yum install -y docker
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```

- The last command adds the current user (in this case, `ec2-user`) to the docker group to avoid needing to use `sudo` each time you run docker commands.

### 5. Install Docker Compose

- Docker Compose is not included in the Amazon Linux repositories. You can install it by executing the following commands:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/<VERSION>/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

- Replace `<VERSION>` with the latest Docker Compose version. You can find the latest version on the [Docker Compose GitHub releases page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases).

### 6. Verify Docker and Docker Compose Installation

- After installation, verify Docker and Docker Compose installation by checking their versions:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

### 7. Configure Docker to Start on Boot

- Ensure Docker starts automatically on system boot:

```bash
sudo chkconfig docker on
```

### 8. Start Using Docker and Docker Compose

- At this point, Docker and Docker Compose should be installed and ready to use. You can now start deploying and managing your containers.

### Important Note:

- Make sure you understand security best practices for running containers in production environments.
- Secure your Docker daemon and containers according to best practices.
- Always use the latest stable versions of Docker and Docker Compose.
- Monitor your resources and consider optimization techniques for better performance.
- Regularly update your system and Docker components to patch security vulnerabilities and benefit from the latest features.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure Docker and Docker Compose on your AWS EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2023 AMI.
